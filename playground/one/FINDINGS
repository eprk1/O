Layout:

Makefile -> Makefile.2

1. A VAR in Makefile can be seen in Makefile.2 if it is above the include line
2. A VAR in Makefile.2 can be seen in Makefile after included
3. A target in Makefile.2 can be added as a pre-req to a target in Makefile
4. If a target with the same name is defined in both Makefile and Makefile.2 then,
    the logic in Makefile is ran (latter). However, pre-reqs are inherited from
    Makefile.2
